MCTSGammon
================
A Search Space Reduction Algorithm for Backgammon game which was written for my master's thesis.
The algorithm used in this project is Monte Carlo Tree Search with some additional tweaks which were supposed to reduce the size of the tree while keeping good results.

A separate application (GNU Backgammon) was used to actually play the game.
